This project focuses on classifying English characters and numbers in various fonts using deep learning. 
The main objective is to find the most efficient deep learning model, optimize it through hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate its performance.

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) was chosen for its effectiveness in image processing. 
The report compares CNN with other models, ultimately selecting CNN for its superior performance in this task.
Additionally, the report highlights the critical role of model selection and tuning in deep learning, offering practical insights into these processes.
